# Lighthouse Labs: Finger Paint Application

Creates an iOS application that allows the user to draw on the screen using their finger.  The application gives a selection of four colours for drawing, the ability to erase parts of the drawing, the ability to undo previous actions, and write text within the drawing.  The application also gives the ability to smooth the lines drawn by the user.


Learning goals: 
Demonstrate the ability to:
- use BezierPaths to dynamically draw on a UIView
- use Autolayout with Size Classes to place controls on screen that dynamically adjust to device type and orientation
- use Gesture Recognizers to respond to user touches
- use animation to move controls on and off screen based on user gestures
